Stepper Motor Syringe Pump

We are using a embedded development kit to control a stepper motor to push and pull a syringe for precise liquid dispensing.
This project includes bluetooth communication for sending an amount of liquid to be dispensed.
The main.cpp has all of the code used on the SJ One Board. We use queues, UART communication, and the built-in task priority system in this project.

Here is a software flow using main.cpp and bluetooth application folder code.
